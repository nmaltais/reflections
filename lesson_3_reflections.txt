When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I would want to collaborate with a team on the same project because we will all be able to push and pull from the remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Maybe you want to have your own version of the remote repository without having the latest changes made by others.
