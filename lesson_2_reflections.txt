What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git directory is created. You need to do that because this tells Git that the directory you are in is a repository. This makes it the main branch.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an area between the working directory and the repository. It is useful to group files before comitting them to the directory.
